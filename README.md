DESCRIPTION
Zombie Event mode for DarkRP

What is it?
Looking for something to spice up your everyday DarkRP? A Zombie Event is just the thing. When triggered, everyone has time to start gearing up for the attack. Although once time is up, a portion of players are randomly selected as the first zombies and begin the invasion. The remaining living players must survive the duration of the event while the zombies attack and turn their next victims. If the zombies get all of the living players, the zombies win. And if the living players survive until the end of the event, they win.
